The war between the Autobots and Decepticons, two factions of robotic life forms from the planet Cybertron, has spilled over to Earth. The Autobots, led by the noble Optimus Prime, seek to protect humanity, while the Decepticons, led by the ruthless Megatron, aim to use the AllSpark (a powerful artifact) to conquer the universe.
